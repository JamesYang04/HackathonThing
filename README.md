# HackathonThing
Program which searches databases for recipes, given a set of grocery materials, restraints (gluten free, halal, allergies, etc).
Developed as part of CMU TartanHacks 2023 (James Yang, Alan Lin, Max Hu, Sophie Feng, collectively known as team Canadian Geese).

# Dataset
Download the recipes dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RrCHyl7BqPEDS33FRhFzN9RawMB18S7e/view?usp=sharing), and copy it to your local repository of HackathonThing once cloned.

# Setup
- Tested with Python 3.10.
- Install dependencies from 'requirements.txt' by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
- On Mac OS: If 'pytesseract' doesn't set up the module path correctly, try running the installation with [Homebrew][https://brew.sh/].
